# Expense Tracker - Financial System

This is a React JS and TypeScript project that simulates a financial system for tracking income and expenses. The user can add transactions, view the current month's balance, and filter expenses by month.

## Project Overview

The system tracks financial data and allows the user to input income and expenses. It displays the total income, total expenses, and the balance for the current month. Users can also filter their transactions by month.

## Features

- Track Income and Expenses: Users can add income or expense items, which are categorized accordingly.
- Filter by Month: Transactions are filtered based on the selected month, and the system calculates the total income and expenses for that month.
- Detailed View: The system shows a table with transaction details including categories, dates, and amounts.
- Responsive Layout: The application is designed to be responsive, adjusting to different screen sizes.
